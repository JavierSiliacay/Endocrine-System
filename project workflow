Project Workflow: LED & Buzzer Monitoring System

1. System Startup
The system initializes all the necessary components, including the LEDs, buzzer, button, and potentiometer. It sets the initial states and begins serial communication for monitoring.

2. Button Handling
The button is used to toggle between two modes of operation: Normal Mode and Abnormal Mode.

NORMAL MODE

Potentiometer Reading
The system reads the analog input from the potentiometer and maps the value from 0–1023 to 0–255. This mapped value controls the LED brightness and various conditions in the system.

Green LED Blinking
The green LED blinks at a speed based on the potentiometer value. If the value is 700 or below, it blinks at a normal rate. If the value is above 700, the blinking speed increases (shorter delays).

Yellow LEDs Cycling
The three yellow LEDs cycle every 700 milliseconds. Only one yellow LED is active at a time, and its brightness depends on the potentiometer’s value. The system divides the brightness into low, medium, and high ranges.

Red LED and Buzzer Conditions
If the mapped potentiometer value reaches the maximum (255), the red LED turns on and the buzzer activates at 3500 Hz to signal a warning.
If the mapped value is 0, the red LED turns off, the buzzer stops, and all yellow LEDs are turned off to reset the system state.

ABNORMALITY MODE

All Alerts Activated
In abnormal mode, all indicators are turned on. The green, red, and all three yellow LEDs are fully lit. The buzzer produces a continuous sound at 4000 Hz to indicate a critical or emergency state.

Mode Reset / Toggle
Pressing the button again switches the system back and forth between Normal Mode and Abnormal Mode, depending on the current state.
